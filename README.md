# Ignite Challenge 02

## This challenge consists of creating middleware to complete the application in node.js

- To start the application first run the command yarn or npm install. After running yarn dev or npm run dev command.

- To test the routes you must send a request to the server address, which by default is: localhost:3333/


*In this challenge I got to know better the concepts of middleware and how to centralize functions that are repeated in middlewares.*
